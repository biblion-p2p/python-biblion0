A library is defined by a JSON document that codifies the structure of the
community.

Every library definition should include these values:

"name"
A user-readable name for the library. Used for making things easier on the client

"owner"
An ID representing the owner of the library

Optional values

"userdb"
Defines a user database for the library.



Per-application configuration

Kademlia
"kademlia.authorization"
Can be "userdb", "owner_check"

BitTorrent
"bittorrent.authorization"
Can

SimpleDownload
Hm, this should probably be merged with BitTorrent actually :^)
