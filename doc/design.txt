# Design overview for the whole thing. This is the closest thing to a whitepaper i'll write up.


Abstract

Biblion is a platform for creating self-defining decentralized data communities.
Nodes within Biblion participate in a global content-addressable file sharing
network. Users can share files, or definition files that define a library: a
community for sharing data. Libraries can define themselves using services
provided by the Biblion application, or define completely custom code. At the
core of Biblion is a modern networking stack that supports peer authentication
and stream multiplexing.

=Overview=

Biblion is a platform for peer-to-peer networks built from the ground up.

- P2P, contentaddressable store
- BitTorrent style downloads
- DHT and blockchain
- Library definitions
  - Ownership and usership
  - Authorization strategies
  - Pluggable routing (DHT, DNS, etc)
- Nanobartering/agorics
- Networking
  - Multiplexing
    - One authentication scheme. Multiple transports.

=Existing Work=

IPFS/Libp2p - The Interplanetary File System[]
MojoNation/Mnet -

Bitcoin
Ethereum
Freenet
Tor

=Core Services=

BitTorrent
Kademlia
Blockchain
Gossip
SimpleBank
UserDB
DataStore

=Library Achitecture=
- Ownership
- Managing users
- Gossip protocols
- Privacy

=Network Architecture=
- Multiplexing of requests, over multiplexed transports
- define "channel"
- QUIC and TLS1.3
- UDP auth cookies
- Peer storage

=Future Work=
-Network hardening (QUIC)
-Additional configuration rules for libraries
-Biblion 2.0 (library configurations should be able to reference arbitrary code)
-Community types and incentive strategies
  - Completely private/disconnected libraries
